# Loghouse

Loghouse is a Django-based REST API for journaling. I created this out of a personal desire to explore new ways of journaling, and wanted a sort of sandbox I could play with and which I could access through multiple channels, such as the web, SMS, or email.

## Current State

This is in the first step, which is to deploy the user accounts and authentication functionality.

* [ ] __Step 1:__ user accounts and deployment.
* [ ] __Step 2:__ make tests for user accounts.
* [ ] __Step 3:__ schema for journal entries.
* [ ] __Step 4:__ create REST API and tests.
* [ ] __Step 5:__ browsing interface.

Somewhere down the road:
* [ ] add posts via email
* [ ] add posts via sms
* [ ] add posts via basic HTML
* [ ] advanced browsing interface.
